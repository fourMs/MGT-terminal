    #      random. `-nostats` forces `ffmpeg` to print just the final result.

    # `-vcodec copy -f rawvideo` We don't want to do any reformating. Force `ffmpeg` to read and write the video as is.
    # `-y /dev/null` Dump read video data. We just want it to count frames we don't care about the data.
    # `awk ...` The line we're interested in has format might look like `frame= 42` or `frame=325`. Because of that
    #     extra space we can't just use `awk` to print the first column and we have to cut everything from the
    #     beggining of the line to the term `fps` (eg. `frame= 152`).
