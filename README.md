The Musical Gestures Toolbox for Terminal is made for doing various video-related tricks in the terminal. The toolbox builds on the other Musical Gestures Toolboxes (for
[Max](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/mgt-max/index.html),
[Matlab](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/mgt-matlab/index.html),
[Python](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python)). All of these
scripting-based toolboxes are slightly different in implementation, but they share the vision of creating powerful, yet fairly simple to use, operations for video visualization.

MGT for Terminal is based on the power of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).


## Installation 

Download and extract the zip-file, or clone to where you want the toolbox: 

    git clone https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-terminal.git

You need to have [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for it to work. On Ubuntu, these can be installed in the terminal like this:

    sudo apt install ffmpeg imagemagick

On other systems you may have to download through the links above.

## Tutorial

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-terminal/wiki).

## History

This toolbox was first developed to test how FFmpeg could be used to create various types of video visualizations. This was the basis for the development of [MGT for Python](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python). The Python version if much more complete, but the Terminal version is handy for various types of bash scripting. 

The software is maintained by the [fourMs lab](https://github.com/fourMs) at [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/) at the University of Oslo.
